# ransomwareDetection
 # BASIC REQUIREMENT
 1. Install python3
 ## Detecting ransomware is a complex task that requires a variety of techniques, including behavioral analysis and signature-based detection.
 ## This example uses a few basic techniques to detect potential ransomware activity:
## It script monitors all running processes on the system and checks if any of the files they have open have extensions commonly associated with ransomware.
## It also checks if any of the files have been modified since the last time they were checked.
## If both of these conditions are true, the script prints a warning message to the console "Potential ransomware activity detected".
## If not it prints "All is well with"
